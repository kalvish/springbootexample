Spring Boot - Basic Rest API Application - Gradle Based (<b>Able to debug in Android Studio</b>)

This application was built following the below mentioned example:
http://spring.io/guides/gs/rest-service/#scratch

You may run this project as follows:

1. cd /Basic_SpringBoot_App

Run directly,
2. ./gradlew bootRun

Or Build project. This will make the executable jar file.
2. ./gradlew build

Then run the Java file as follows:

java -jar /build/libs/your_final_jar_file.jar

Or Open the project root folder (i.e. /Basic_SpringBoot_App) from Android Studio or IntelliJ (Haven't tested).
With this method, when I opened from Android Studio, I managed to <b>debug the application</b>
